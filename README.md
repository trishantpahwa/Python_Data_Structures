# Python_Data_Structures
This is a tutorial to demonstrate how data structures can be created and later used in Python. I hope it helps.

You can view the repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/trishantpahwa/Python_Data_Structures), or at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FEUn6hnSKYk).

The data structures are user-defined data structures. If you want to read about the built-in data structures you can visit the documentation of the particular language you are following. For Python, they can be viewed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).

User-Defined data structure is of 2 types:
 - Linear
 - Non-Linear

## Linear Data-Structures
 - Stack { Dynamic }
 - Queue { Dynamic }
 - Linked List { Dynamic }
 - Arrays { Static }
 
 > Dynamic data structures are the type of data structure whose length is not determined before run-time. They extract memory from heap every time there is a new entry.
 
 > Static data structures are the type of data structure whose length is defined before run-time. They extract memory at compile time.

## Non-Linear Data-Structures
 - Trees
 - Graphs
