# Python_Data_Structures

Welcome!

This is a tutorial to demonstrate how data structures can be created and later used in Python. I hope this helps.

You can view the repository at [Github](https://github.com/trishantpahwa/Python_Data_Structures), or at Youtube.

These Data Structures are user defined data structures. If you want you can view the built-in data structures of languages on their own documentation. For Python they can be viewed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).

User-Defined Data Structures can be of 2 types:
 - Linear
 - Non-Linear

 ## Linear
 - Stack { Dynamic }
 - Queue { Dynamic }
 - Linked Lists { Dynamic }
 - Arrays { Static }
  > Static means their length or size is pre-defined before run-time.
  > Dynamic means of variable size at run-time.
 ## Non-Linear
 - Trees
 - Graphs
